    <p>The hooded sweatshirt also called “hoodie” is a very popular part of everyone’s wardrobe and the trend of wearing hoodies is unstoppable even in 2019. That is why we have an endless choice of different colors, sizes, and shapes of hoodies. The hoodie is a typical streetwear fashion, mostly because it can be worn on every occasion.</p>
    <p>Whether it's a hangover at home, a park run or a party with friends. At least this is from my observation!</p>

    <p>In this article, I want to talk about the hoodies size chart. Because of thousands of hoodies and different brands, there are different sizes and measurements.</p>
    <p>You can never rely on your chosen size, which works for one type of sweatshirt that you wear happily for years. For example, I had this intuition that all of my sweatshirts are the size of L, but with these thoughts, you will fail in online fashion shopping, as did I.</p>
    <br>
    <p style="font-size: 150%"><strong>So what should we do?</strong></p>
    <p>First of all, you need to get parameters of your best, most comfortable hoodie you have.</p>
    <p>If you want to buy hoodie for someone, you should find out which hoodie that person wear the most. Then you need to get basic parameters like width and length of a hoodie.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Pictures below show my best hoodie that I love even today and how I measure it with precision. Be careful, the measuring tape should be taught.</p>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col">
        <img src="{% static 'Length1.jpg' %}" alt="how to measure length hoodies" style="max-width:50rem; width: 100%; padding-top:4rem; padding-bottom: 4rem">
      </div>
      <div class="col">
        <img src="{% static 'Length2.jpg' %}" alt="how to measure length hoodies detail" style="max-width:50rem; width: 100%; padding-top:4rem; padding-bottom: 4rem">
      </div>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>With my measuring tape, I know that my hoodies length is <strong>72cm</strong> and width is around <strong>53cm.</strong></p>
    <br>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col">
        <img src="{% static 'Width1.jpg' %}" alt="how to measure width hoodies" style="max-width:50rem; width: 100%; padding-top:4rem; padding-bottom: 4rem">
      </div>
      <div class="col">
        <img src="{% static 'Width2.jpg' %}" alt="how to measure width hoodies detail" style="max-width:50rem; width: 100%; padding-top:4rem; padding-bottom: 4rem">
      </div>
    </div>
    <p style="font-size: 150%"><strong>Congratulations, the first part is finished. Now let's see what is next</strong></p>
    <p>Now you know exactly, what size is your most comfortable hoodie without relying on size charts. But what is next?</p>
    <p>For this step, I introduced the size search engine for fashion. It is just an easy online tool for everyone to use. And input is based on parameters which you already know - width and length of your hoodie.</p>
    <p>So, if I copy my parameters to size search engine it shows that there are more than <strong>100+</strong> sweatshirts, jumpers and hoodies for men with these parameters.</p>
    <img src="{% static 'blog2pic2.jpg' %}" alt="parameters in size search engine" style="max-width:50rem; width: 100%; padding-top:4rem; padding-bottom: 4rem">
    <p>Although it shows all products with +2cm from my measuring parameters, it is a good sign, because I can choose from dozens and I know it will fit me perfectly!</p>
    <p>Now if you could look closer on sizes with different brands you can see that I prove my point.</p>
    <img src="{% static 'blog2pic3.jpg' %}" alt="parameters in size search engine" style="max-width:50rem; width: 100%; padding-top:4rem; padding-bottom: 4rem">
    <p><strong>Different brands have indeed different sizes</strong> and we, as a customers, are not able to see it at first look easily.</p>
    <p>This finding really pissed me off and also motivated me to continue with comfy-penguin.com with its size search engine. Now I know that size charts are not a solution for buying hoodies and other fashion online.</p>
    <br>
    <p>What I want to do is to create an online tool to help search and find clothes with exactly the same parameters as your best, most comfortable clothes you wear daily. It will take some time, but one day there will be thousands of products on each category, which will make online shopping fast and stressless.</p>
    <p>The goal is to use this data to find a new hoodies or jumpers without fearing that you end up with a completely wrong size.</p>
    <br>
    <p style="font-size: 150%"><strong>To proof my statements I bought and measure offered sweatshirt</strong></p>
    <p>I decided to go with this sweatshirt instead of a hoodie, kinda like it more. It is slightly bigger (which I want) and it says that I should choose size M.</p>

    <p>Let’s see how it end up with parameters for this sweatshirt from Amazon.</p>
